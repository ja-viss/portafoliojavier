# Blueprint: PortfolioPerfect Website

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for fixing and enhancing the PortfolioPerfect website. The goal is to create a visually appealing and fully functional single-page portfolio that adheres to modern web standards.

## Current State & Issues

The website currently has several styling and layout issues that need to be addressed:
*   **Broken Header:** The navigation menu is not displaying correctly.
*   **Misaligned Content:** The main content sections are not properly aligned.
*   **Outdated Copyright:** The copyright year is listed as 2017.
*   **Generic Content:** The portfolio and about sections contain placeholder text.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Layout and Styling

1.  **Fix Header Navigation:** Correct the CSS to ensure the navigation bar is responsive and displays correctly on all screen sizes.
2.  **Adjust Hero Section:** Ensure the hero section is properly aligned and the content is centered.
3.  **Correct CSS Paths:** The `index.html` file has incorrect paths for some of the CSS files. These will be corrected.
4.  **Update Copyright:** Change the copyright year to the current year.

### Phase 2: Content and Feature Enhancements

1.  **Update About Section:** Replace the placeholder text in the about section with more meaningful content.
2.  **Populate Portfolio:** Add real project information to the portfolio section, including titles, descriptions, and links.
3.  **Add Web Components:** Introduce web components for reusable elements like cards and buttons to improve code organization and maintainability.
4.  **Implement Modern CSS:** Utilize modern CSS features like container queries, cascade layers, and logical properties to create a more robust and maintainable stylesheet.
5.  **Improve Accessibility:** Ensure the website is accessible to all users by following a11y standards.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)

1.  **3D Graphics with Three.js:** If requested, a 3D-enhanced version of the portfolio could be created.
2.  **WebAssembly Integration:** For any computationally intensive tasks, WebAssembly could be integrated to improve performance.

This blueprint will be updated as the project progresses.
