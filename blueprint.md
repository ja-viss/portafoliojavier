## Current Task: Dark/Light Theme

*   **Goal:** Implement a dark/light theme switcher to allow users to choose their preferred viewing mode.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  **Create `theme.css`:**  A new CSS file will be created to define the color schemes for the light and dark themes using CSS variables.
    2.  **Modify `index.html`:** A theme toggle button will be added to the navigation bar.
    3.  **Create `theme.js`:**  A new JavaScript file will be created to handle the theme switching logic and save the user's preference in `localStorage`.
    4.  **Update `script.js`:** The main script will be updated to initialize the theme switching functionality.
